# python notebook to train Simple Linear Regression

This repository contains an example of a machine learning model (Linear Regression) for predicting population. It includes a Python notebook that details the process of data preparation and model training, as well as instructions on how to save the trained model.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Create a virtual environment.
2. Install the required packages in the environment:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maheshmani13/world-population-growth) and place it in the `dataset` folder. (if you want to retrain the model)
4. Run the `LinearRegression.ipynb` file for training the model.

## Usage

It is the simplest linear regression model. It predicts the population growth based on the number of years passed since the last census. It just describes the training process of linear regression model and shows the metrics of the model.
